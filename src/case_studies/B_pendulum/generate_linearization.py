# TODO - this form of substitution is OK because they are all 0, however, substituting
# 0 (or any constant) for theta, will also make thetad zero. This is a known issue - (see "substitution"
# at https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/physics/mechanics/advanced.html). Future
# examples should substitute for dynamic symbols after the EOM are derived, and before
# substituting in the equilibrium points. It may be OK because velocity variables like
# thetad and zd should be zero at an equilibrium point, and would be for any constant value
# of the generalized coordinates in the state vector, but it is something to be aware of.

# see also use of "msubs" at link above for speed up in substitution in large expressions.
